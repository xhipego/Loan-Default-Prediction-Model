# Loan Default Prediction: Credit Risk Modeling in African Financial Markets

## 📌 Project Overview

This project aims to develop a robust and generalisable machine learning model to **predict the likelihood of loan default** based on customer financial data. Accurate default prediction is vital for financial institutions to mitigate risk, optimize lending strategies, and expand services across Africa’s dynamic economic landscape.

By building a predictive model and credit scoring system, this project supports scalable, data-driven decision-making that minimizes financial losses and fosters financial inclusion.

## 🧠 Problem Statement

> **Can you predict the likelihood of a customer defaulting on a loan based on their financial data?**

In rapidly growing financial markets across Africa, lenders face unique challenges due to:
- Diverse customer demographics
- Incomplete or inconsistent financial histories
- Evolving economic conditions

This project seeks to address these challenges by:
- Developing a model that predicts loan default probabilities
- Creating a scalable credit scoring function that classifies risk categories

## 🎯 Objectives

- Build a predictive machine learning model to estimate the **probability of loan default**
- Engineer features that account for regional, financial, and behavioral factors
- Develop a **credit scoring function** that bins model outputs into **risk levels**
- Ensure **generalisation** to both existing customers and new applicants
- Propose actionable insights for **credit risk management**
